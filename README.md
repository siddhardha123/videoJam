# ðŸ’¡ **Problem Statement**

The traditional educational model is limited by physical constraints, leaving many educators struggling to monetize their expertise while learners struggle to access high-quality, exclusive content. There is a lack of secure and exclusive platforms that enable educators to monetize their content while providing learners with engaging and collaborative learning experiences. Additionally, many online educational platforms are vulnerable to hacking and data breaches, which can result in the loss of personal and sensitive data. There is a need for a secure and innovative platform that allows educators to monetize their content while providing learners with exclusive access to high-quality materials and fostering a sense of community and collaboration.





# ðŸ’ª **Challenges Faced 

Integrating the Lighthouse SDK was a challenging task that required a lot of effort and attention to detail. Initially, I found it difficult to navigate through the documentation and understand the technicalities involved in the integration process. However, I persevered by reading the documentation multiple times and seeking help from the development team in the Discord channel.

One of the major challenges I faced was configuring the SDKs to work with our project's requirements. It took a considerable amount of time and experimentation to get everything working correctly. Moreover, there were some small but tricky technical hurdles that I encountered along the way, which required debugging and troubleshooting to resolve.
